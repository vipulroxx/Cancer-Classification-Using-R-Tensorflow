## Purposes

#### I. Breast cancer tumour classification

```
The main purpose of the project is to predict whether cancer present is through
benign tumor or malignant through the use of neural networks.
```

#### II. Tensorflow with R and using Shiny package

```
Through this project I will learn how to build neural networks using tensorflow with
R and know how to make apps on R through Shiny.
```
#### III. Why am I interested in this project?

```
I am interested in this project because it helps me understand the depth on how
oncology works and connecting it to artificial intelligence. This project will hopefully
help me acquire skills on how to tackle various difficult situations that I might get
stuck on while building this project.
```
## Data

#### IV. What is the data?

```
The data set I used is called Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The
features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a
beast mass which describes characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
```

#### V. How was the data collected?

```
Data was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T), a classification method
which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.
```

#### VI. Who collected the data?

```

## Data Structure

#### VII. Attribute Information

```
1. Sample code number id number
2. Clump Thickness 1 - 10
3. Uniformity of Cell Size 1 - 10
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape 1 - 10
5. Marginal Adhesion 1 - 10
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size 1 - 10
7. Bare Nuclei 1 - 10
8. Bland Chromatin 1 - 10
9. Normal Nucleoli 1 - 10
10. Mitoses 1 - 10
```

#### VIII. Attribute Description

```
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
```
#### IX. NA’s and Coding Issues

```
There are no NA’s in the dataset. There might be coding issues later on in the
project.
```
#### X. Size

```
The data has (569, 33) as its shape which has exactly 30000 samples.
```

## How did I get the data

```
I got the data through this link :

<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%>
```

## Outline the steps necessary to access the data

```
To access the data follow the following url:

```

## Downloading the data

```
Follow these steps in order to download the data:

- Click on the following link:
    <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/
    breast-cancer-wisconsin.data>
- Go to ​breast-cancer-wisconsin.data​ and save it (Ctrl + S / Cmd + S).
```

## Further Information

```
- I did not have to change data since the data was very well conditioned.
- To import the data I uploaded the data and read it through the console.
