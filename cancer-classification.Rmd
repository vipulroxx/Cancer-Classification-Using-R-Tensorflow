## What is the data?

```
The data set I used is called Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The
features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a
beast mass which describes characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
```

## How was the data collected?

```
Data was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T), a classification method
which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.
```

## Who collected the data?

## Graph Visualizations

### Mean Graphs

```
This graph plots means of three real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus which are:
- Radius Mean : Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
- Texture Mean : Standard deviation of gray-scale values
- Perimeter Mean : Mean of the perimeter
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- plot_ly(dataset, 
             x = dataset$perimeter_mean,
             y = dataset$radius_mean,
             z = dataset$texture_mean, 
             marker = list(
                 color = c(dataset$perimeter_mean, dataset$radius_mean, dataset$texture_mean),
                 colorscale = c('#965F8A', '#FF7070', '#C61951'), showscale = TRUE)) %>%
